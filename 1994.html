    Nonexistent Gambits is an organization that offers web design resources that can teach you how to build your own website.
    From the basics to the advanced tricks that the Mosaic browser allows, there is nothing our books don't cover!

         An early version of Mosaic (which later became Firefox) allowed designers to code tables in 1993."-->
