<head><h1>Principles Behind 1991's User Interface</h1></head>
<p>
    This web page is an attempt to mimic the first website. According to the information on the first website,
    there were only 18 HTML tags usable in 1991. CSS, Javascript, and even the ability to embed images
    did not exist. Glossaries are used to group text together and headings are used to emphasize text.
    Hyperlinks appear blue and underlined. The site's layout mimiced that of a file hierarchy with separate
    pages acting as folders. There was no immediately discernable home page link on every page, which made
    navigating the website more confusing.
