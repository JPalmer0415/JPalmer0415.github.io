            This webpage attempts to mimic the user interface of a website's homepage in 1994. Displaying images is now possible, leading to the
            use of banners and icons. Additionaly the Mosaic browser allowed developers to implement features which were not formally 
            introduced into HTML such as tables. Websites tended to use a white or gray background color. White was the default, but gray is 
            easier on the eyes while remaining unobtrusive. Icons tended to be placed near text to signify what the text links to. Banners
            were used to display a prominent message. There were no standards yet.
